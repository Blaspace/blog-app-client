## Project Overview

MySocial is a personal project developed with the aim of showcasing my skills in full-stack web development. It combines frontend and backend technologies to create a social media platform that allows users to interact, post content, and customize their profiles. The project focuses on implementing key features such as user authentication, post creation and editing, profile customization, and secure data storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** MySocial incorporates user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to user accounts and protecting sensitive data.

- **Post Creation and Editing:** Users can create posts and share their thoughts, experiences, or any content they wish to share. The application allows post editing to refine and improve the content even after it has been shared.
